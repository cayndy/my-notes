This session took place on Discord, and we mostly went over the different locations of the Ironlands. We decided to start our adventure on the ragged coasts. Our starting quest is below:

# Background Knowledge

## Basics  
The "Basics" part of the rulebook briefly went over some setting-related facts, and I'll be putting these here. 

1. The weather and terrain make not only living here hard but also traveling hard and dangerous. 
2. Many areas of the ironlands are unexplored by anyone other than the firstborn.  
3. Coins are effectively useless, and bartering is the only real way to trade.  
4. Spears, axes, shields, and bows are the main weapons, as metalworking is not a well-known practice.  
5. Magic is subtle and dangerous.  
6. Supernatural creatures are rare and extremely dangerous.  
## Travel  
Travel in the Ironlands has difficulty ranks, just like the other aspects of the game. They rank from troublesome to epic, depending on how far your character(s) are traveling.

## Firstborn  
There are three types of firstborns: elves, wolf-like varou, and giants. As this is only the second time we've seen the firstborn mentioned, we still have very little knowledge of them. What we do know is this: they were here long before any humans, or "the broken."  They each live in specific regions of the ironlands and they are known to either hate humans or simply ignore them. 

  
# Regions  
As we previously covered, there are nine regions of the Ironlands. Each of these regions is unique and has its advantages and drawbacks. Here is a map along with some basic summaries for each region.

## Barrier Islands  
Small and numerous islands are mostly inhabited by fishermen and pirates. Long-decayed ships are found in bulk here, along with seagulls and harsh winds.

Raider ships are a threat in the region, as anyone who's caught too close to them is sure to get robbed and left for dead.

## Ragged Coasts  
A coast covered in fjords (a long, narrow, deep inlet of the sea between high cliffs). Settlements are filled with fisherfolk, traders, and raiders alike. 

The water here hosts many massive sea serpents just waiting to sink any unsuspecting ship that stray too close.

## Deep Wilds  
The typical forest setting. Untouched by human hands, this region is only inhabited by elves, always watching out for the signs of humans. 

Suspicious noises like growling and skittering come from the ever-present mist.

## Flooded Lands  
Swampy wetlands with mysterious ghost lights, biting insects, and ponds covered in mist.

Creatures wait under the bog, waiting for their next victim to walk close enough to whisper impossible promises.

## Havens  
A large region of forests, rivers, shrublands, and low hills is home to New Haven and the many settlements surrounding it. It is a relatively peaceful place to live in the unforgiving land known as the Ironlands, and as such, it is known as the best place to live.

Not only is the long weather harsh in the region, but the settlements have a very similar reception to anyone they deem outsiders.

## Hinterlands  
This region is filled with forested hills that only seem to get higher with no end in sight. The iron landers in this area are either hunters or foragers who, at the end of the day, retreat to their settlements under the protection of their fire and bright lights.

Hungry beasts are not the only danger in this region, as walk-like varou are always on the prowl.

## Tempest Hills  
Rugged hills and low mountains, thin woods, and grassy plains leading to the Veild Mountains are the sights that you can see in the tempest hills. The settlements here are mostly for mining, with the occasional trading caravan or nomadic encampment.

Giants are present in this region, although they are wary enough of humans to stay away in most instances.

## Veiled Mountains  
Multiple mountains peek well over the clouds and are only inhabited by the skeletons of those who were misguided enough to believe they could survive not only the freezing temperatures but the circling wyverns near every peak.

Be aware of wild beasts, below-freezing temperatures, and wyverns who intend to impede every step you take in this region.

## Shattered Wastes  
Ice and monsters are the only things you will see in this region. Although the ice is fully natural, the horror that breaks through the ice is not. Other than the monsters, this area is fully uninhibited.
