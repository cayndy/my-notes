### Momentum

The more momentum you have the better. Momentum is how prepared you are at any given moment. It does not naturally reset between sessions. 

You can burn momentum by using your current momentum to cancel out your challenge dice. If your momentum is higher than both die then you can cancel out both die but if it only passes one then you can cancel out the die it does pass. This resets your momentum.

### Harm & Stress

#### Harm

This represents physical harm and fatigue

Inflicting harm happens when you attack a foe. You automatically inflict 1 harm if you succeed with one more added if you have a deadly weapon and more added depending on the circumstances. This scales depending on what rank your enemy is.

You can regain health through heal, making camp or sojourn
#### Stress

this represents mental burdens and trauma. these also have challenging ranks. foes can inflict stress but you cannot inflict stress yourself (debatable but ok)

you can recover spirit by making camp, sojourn, or forging a bond
### Assets

key components of your characters. these are the closest things that you can get to classes in this game. make sure you don't select the same assets as a different player.

## **Ironlands**

The Ironlands is the main setting of Ironsworn. It is filled with isolated communities and untracked wilds. It is an extremely harsh place to live, with winters being brutal and trading difficult and dangerous. Your people are not the only beings who occupy the Ironlands.

- two generations ago, your people were driven from their homes in the Old World and now live in the Ironlands
- there are no thriving cities, only isolated VILLAGES WITH HOMES MADE OF WOOD, STONE, OR THATCH
- the firstborn- beings like elves, giants, and wolf-like varou - have existed here long before your people have come here and don't like intruders
- coins are not very valuable, help and bartering are your best bet.
- spears, axes, shields, and bows and the most common weapons. swords are rare and prized and armor is not widespread with most people trusting their bodies or their shields.
- mystics are people who practice magic but usually fall victim to it. magic is subtle and performed through rituals for blessings
- supernatural beings are rare and dangerous
- equipment and other worries are represented in the "supply" section of your player sheet. assume you have everything you need when this track is filled.
